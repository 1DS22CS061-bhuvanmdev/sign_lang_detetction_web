# Sign Language Detection Model with Flask Web Integration

## Overview
This project is a sign language detection model that is integrated into a web application using Flask. The model is built using TensorFlow and MediaPipe, with Redis employed for efficient data handling. The key features of this project include real-time training of the model, a user-friendly website and ease of use.

## Features
- **Real-Time Model Training**: Update and train the model on-the-fly with new sign language data.
- **Web Integration**: A Flask-based web application that allows users to interact with the sign language detection model.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- Flask
- Redis
